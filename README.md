In this project, I started with an Excel dataset. In VS code, I read the excel file and performed thorough data cleaning. I standardized all column names by converting them to uppercase, replacing spaces with underscores, removing special characters, and replacing slashes. I removed unnecessary columns, keeping only the data relevant for my analysis. I also converted area columns from “1000 HA” to hectares and production columns from “1000 TONS” to kilograms. To ensure consistency, I set STATE_NAME and DIST_NAME as strings and YEAR as an integer, and I verified the cleaned data by checking the first few rows and dataset info. After cleaning, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pie Charts, Bar Charts, Donut Charts, Line Plots, and Scatter Plots. I analyzed questions such as top rice and wheat producing states, oilseed and sunflower production, sugarcane trends over 50 years, district-wise rice production, millet and sorghum production, groundnut and soybean yields, and the impact of area cultivated on production and yield across crops. Next, I loaded the cleaned dataset into Visual Studio, wrote the SQL connection code, created a database, and inserted the data into SQL tables. I wrote SQL queries to answer 10 specific questions, including trends in rice, wheat, cotton, and oilseed production, district-wise yield improvements, area vs. production correlations, and comparison of crop production over years. Finally, I pushed the SQL data into Power BI and created interactive dashboards and charts, which allowed me to visualize agricultural trends effectively and provide actionable insights for farmers, policymakers, and researchers.
